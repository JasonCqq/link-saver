## 🔗 LinkStorage

Need a place to store links you want to revisit?

**LinkStorage** is a web application that lets you save, organize, preview, and revisit your favorite links — all in one place.  
You can preview, watch, or visit links directly within the website, making it easy to manage everything you want to come back to later.

## 📖 About The Project

LinkStorage was built to solve a simple problem:  
**saving links is easy — previewing, and revisiting them fast along with other features is not.**

This project focuses on:

- An experience to revisit links better with video embeds, or visiting links within the site
- Rich previews / screenshots
- Clean organization
- Flexible storage option

## ✨ Features

- 📸 Store URLs with automatic previews or screenshots

- 📝 URL Bank — store links in plain text and add many at once
- 🔍 Search, sort (by visits, date, name), and bookmark links
- 📁 Organize links using folders
- 🔗 Share folders publicly or privately  
  👉 Example: https://linkstorage.net/public/1

- 🔐 Secure authentication (bcrypt, Passport, express-session)
- ✉️ Email verification & OTP-based security
- 📱 Fully responsive design with UX-focused tooltips

## 🧩 Browser Extension

LinkStorage also includes a **browser extension** that makes saving links even faster.

### What the extension does:

- Save the current tab or multiple tabs with one click
- Send links directly to your:
  - Dashboard
  - URL Bank
  - Bookmarks
- Syncs securely with your LinkStorage account
- Designed for speed and minimal friction

🧪 **Status:**  
The extension is currently **in the process of being uploaded to the Google Chrome Web Store**.

## 🧠 Learning Experience

This project was created not only to build something useful, but also to explore and compare different technologies.

- Learned Angular and compared it to React
- Transitioned from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for relational data
- Gained experience with Prisma and structured schemas
- Built real-time features with Socket.IO
- Improved backend reliability with Playwright fallbacks

Overall, Angular’s structure and PostgreSQL’s relational model felt more natural for this project.  
The app will continue to be updated, optimized, and expanded with new features.
